# cse270f_finalproject

A Clojure library containing a few simple image filters, implementing Mikera's 'Imagez' library for image manipulation.
Created as a project for CSE270F, Functional Programming at Miami University.


Why I chose Clojure to do any image processing is beyond me, but here it is.
